I'm Antony. I've been programming for over 10 years and I'm mostly self-taught. During those 10 years, I've gained 2 years of professional experience so far. I'm 22 years old.

Don't flame me too hard for some of the stuff you see in here, though.

I'm new to GitHub, and there's still a lot out there for me to learn. When I first started programming, I was honestly too scared to get on here. Still am, but it's finally time to bite the bullet.

My strengths are AutoHotkey, JavaScript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, VBScript, Visual Basic (mostly 6.0), and most types of SQL; and I'm learning more about Java and C++ (more comfortable with Java).

I've mastered all Windows Operating Systems (95 and later); I am fluent in most Linux systems, and used a Mac twice (one was to look for jobs - I couldn't even open the browser, the last time was to [successfully] remove malware for a friend).

My favorite thing to do is learn. If you have a project that you'd consider my skills for, send me an email at ameadows117@gmail.com with a link to your profile. Additionally, if you want to mentor me; do the same - I would greatly appreciate it.
